Instagram-like site

Created by: Oswaldo Sosa

This is my attempt at an Instagram-like site, which allows users to register for the site and have the ability to post
pictures. I followed a tutorial from Beginner Programmers that was posted on Youtube on September 6th, 2015. The title
of the video is "Make an instagram like site in under 30 minutes! (Ruby on Rails)". 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE) 
Used the Bootstrap Bare template to format the site.

Functionality:
Users are able to register for an account by providing an email address and password.

Users are able to log into their account after creating an account. The user will receive a notification alerting them
that they successfully logged in.

Once a user logs into their account they can see all their posts.

Users can create a new post, using the "New Post" tab. They can choose a file from their computer (.png or .jpg) to 
upload and are able to put a description of the image.

Users are able to log out of theur own account, by clicking on the "Logout" tab. The user will receive a notification
to confirm their request to log out and will also receive another notification alerting them they logged out successfully.
